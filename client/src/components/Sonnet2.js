              A joint collaboration between rxbshoes and Andrey Bartenev, one of
              the most recognizable contemporary artists. His work refers us to
              childish sincerity, to pure emotions and the joy of life that goes
              on, no matter what. This collection is beautiful and
              life-affirming. And the bears turned out to be not only childishly
              cute, but also mysterious: smiling slyly, they know something, but
              do not speak.
